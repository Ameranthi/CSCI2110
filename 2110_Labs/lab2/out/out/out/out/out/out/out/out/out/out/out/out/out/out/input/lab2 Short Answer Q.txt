Short answer Q:

The java.lang.OutOfMemoryError exception can mean : I only have a certain amount of default memory space and I went over the memory aka I ran out of memory. 
Or 
OutOfMemoryError could mean that you are holding onto objects too long, or trying to process too much data at a time. (Probably the later)
sometimes, it has nothing to do with objects on the heap.
